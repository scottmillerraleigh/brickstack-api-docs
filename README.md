# Overview BrickStack API

![BrickStack API logo](./images/brickstack_api.png "BrickStack API logo")

Welcome to `BrickStack!` BrickStack is an API that stores information about LEGO sets.

Use BrickStack to browse LEGO sets in a database to view more details about a specific LEGO set.

You can browse by many attributes to help you find the right set for you.

Some examples are:

* Piece count
* Release year
* Price range
* Theme

If you notice anything incorrect or missing in the API for the existing LEGO sets,
you can either update an existing set or add a new set.

You can also start a collection to help keep track of your own LEGO sets.

## Workflow

Here is how the BrickStack API works.

![BrickStack API architecture diagram](./images/api_architecture_diagram.png "BrickStack API architecture diagram")

You use a terminal app like Git Bash or Postman. With your local json server installed,
you send a request to the BrickStack API. You are interacting with 1 of the 4 resources
that are available on the API. The request that you make modifies the json database.

## Quick Start

[Browse all sets](./quick_start.md) - Use this guide to see how
easy and fun BrickStack is to use!

You only have to do this process one time per development system.

* [Setup](./setup.md)

After your system is ready, read these tutorials to learn how to perform common tasks in BrickStack.

* [Get all sets](./tutorials/sets-get-all-sets-tutorial.md)
* [Update an existing set](./tutorials/sets-put-one-set-tutorial.md)

## API reference docs

Detailed descriptions of the service's resources.

The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they
refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends
on the installation of the service.

When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is
usually `http://localhost:3000`.
