# Patch existing theme

![BrickStack Reference](./reference.png "BrickStack Reference")

Partially updates an existing theme in the [`themes`](../resource/themes.md) resource.

As opposed to the `PUT` request or `POST` request,
a `PATCH` request only updates the entered attributes.
You do not need to enter all attributes to send a `PATCH` request.

## URL

```shell
{server_url}/themes/
```

## cURL example

Patch an existing theme. The changed values overwrite the existing values.

### cURL command

```shell
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/themes/7 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "multiple build possibilities from 1 set"    
  }'
```

### cURL response

The response displays the following. Although you updated
only partial attributes of the resource, the response
contains all the attributes of the resource.

```json
{
  "id": 7,
  "name": "Creator 3in1",
  "description": "multiple build possibilities from 1 set"
}
```

## Postman example

Patch an existing theme. The changed values overwrite the existing values.

### Request

**Method**:

```shell
PATCH http://localhost:3000/themes/7/
```

### Postman response

The response will display the theme that you just patched.

```json
{
    "id": 7,
    "name": "Creator 3in1",
    "description": "multiple builds possible with just 1 set"
}
```
