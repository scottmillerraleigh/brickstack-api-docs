# Patch existing set

![BrickStack Reference](../images/reference.png "BrickStack Reference")

Partially updates an existing set in the [`sets`](./sets.md) resource.

As opposed to the `PUT` request or `POST` request,
a `PATCH` request only updates the entered attributes.
You do not need to enter all attributes to send a `PATCH` request.

## URL

```shell
{server_url}/sets
```

## cURL example

Patch an existing set. The changed values overwrite the existing values.

### cURL command

```shell
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/sets/27 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pieces": 1850,
    "releaseYear": 2022
  }'
```

### cURL response

The response displays the following. Although you updated
only partial attributes of the resource, the response
contains all the attributes of the resource.

```json
{
  "id": 27,
  "setNumber": "10236",
  "name": "Shell Gas Station",
  "theme": "City",
  "pieces": 1850,
  "minifigures": 5,
  "releaseYear": 2022,
  "ageRange": "16+",
  "price": 200,
  "retired": false,
  "tags": [
    "city",
    "store",
    "vehicles"
  ]
}
```

## Postman example

Patch an existing set. The changed values overwrite the existing values.

### Request

**Method**:

```shell
PATCH http://localhost:3000/sets/27
```

### Postman response

The response will display the set that you just patched.

```json
{
    "id": 27,
    "setNumber": "10236",
    "name": "Shell Gas Station",
    "theme": "City",
    "pieces": 1715,
    "minifigures": 5,
    "releaseYear": 2025,
    "ageRange": "16+",
    "price": 200,
    "retired": false,
    "tags": [
        "city",
        "store",
        "vehicles"
    ]
}
```
